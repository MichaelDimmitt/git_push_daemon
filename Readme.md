# Make sure them "git Push" 
Personally I dont run into this problem; 
<br>But people I interact  with definately do
<pre>                               they know they do.</pre>
Sometimes I am waiting for changes that they never pushed. 
<br>For all the programmers who like to commit locally and never push.
<br><b>With LOVE this is made for you. #made #with #love #or-atleast-noble-intentions.</b>
## Why, per user request, but also it seems a good use of a daemon. 
ASK: "You made a supervisor program(daemon) background process that monitored another background process(daemon) ... (jokingly) If only there was a program that pushed my commits before shutting down my computer."

Me: "Actually, achievable/doable, what operating system? Ive done for a mac, linux should be strait forward."
<br>ASK: "Windows operating system"
<br>Me: "windows... ouch . I will have to take a look!"

Daemon process to monitor for shutdown ... keep computer alive until resolved. 
<br>First Pass: Search all git projects on computer for commits ready to be pushed. 
<br>Ignore files that have staged or have not yet been staged.
<br>Second Pass: How does the programmer want to interact with unstagged/stagged commit's with no commit message.
<br>Second Pass will take up time. Possibly they are a `git add -p`. 
<br>Possibly automated blunt(not recommend) or possibly ignore.

## Requirements
sooo... sadly it has to be windows. 
<br>You have been waiting, and now I will have to learn a windows thing.
<br>Meaning <b>possible future windows support of my other applications, after this project. </b>

## This is a good initial step. More to come.
